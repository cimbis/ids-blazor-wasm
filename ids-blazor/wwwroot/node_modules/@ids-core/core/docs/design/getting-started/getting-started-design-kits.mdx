Our primary design kit is [Figma](/design/getting-started/design-kits/figma), we also have [Adobe XD](/design/getting-started/design-kits/xd) kit available.

By using the kits you automatically get any updates made by the IDS team so you don't need to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And when handing off to your developers there won't be confusion about the component and its behaviors.

    Under [Resources](/resources) you can download fonts and icons and get access to our repositories.
