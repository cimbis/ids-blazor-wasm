### When to use

<TextLayoutLeft>

Forms are incredibly common in user interfaces and their design and usage continues to evolve as input methods get
smarter and more and more people use mobile and tablet devices. You might design a form for a user to:

-   Sign up for / log into an account
-   Register for a service
-   Reconfigure settings, (e.g. enabling notifications)
-   Take a survey
-   Purchase a product
-   Provide feedback

</TextLayoutLeft>

### Respect the user

<TextLayoutLeft>

Forms are meant to gather information and guide people with as little fuss as possible. To allow users to scan and
complete the form quickly, forms should:

-   Respect the user’s GDPR and other privacy regulations by only asking for information that is absolutely necessary.
-   Group related tasks under section titles to provide more context and make the interface easier to scan.
-   Follow a logical, predictable order—e.g first name first, last name second.
-   Allow users to stay with a single interaction method for as long as possible (i.e. do not make users shift from
    keyboard to mouse numerous times in a single form).
-   When designing be mindful of password managers and browser capabilities that populate data for users.
-   Progressively disclose additional inputs only as they become relevant
