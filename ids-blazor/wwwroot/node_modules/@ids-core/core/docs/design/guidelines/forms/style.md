### Accessibility

<TextLayoutLeft>

When constructing a form, first refer to the specific accessibility guidance for each component used. Every text input
should have a descriptive and visible label, along with hard coded instructions for input format. A form must be wrapped
in a `<form>` element.

Requirements for your form should be announced and declared before the user enters the form.

The most significant challenge facing visually impaired users is form ordering. Your form should be tab-navigable, and
required fields should be clearly labeled as such.

Validation messages should be included to advise the user of data that is input incorrectly or a required field that is
missing information.

Helper text (`label`) should be used to provide instructions to help users understand how to complete the form fields as
well as indicate any required and optional input, data formats, and other relevant information.

See the [WCAG website](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/forms/instructions/) for in-depth accessibility guidance for
each form element.
