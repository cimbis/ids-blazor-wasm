You can start your own local component development server with this command at root:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev -- <component-folder-name>
```

For example:

```bash
$ npm run start:dev -- hero
```

This will:

-   Start a local webserver for the hero component
-   Watch for changes in the `src`, `docs` and `demo`-folder
-   Build the bundle
-   Build the styleguide
-   Live reload the dev index.html file

## Local dev server

<div class="if text body">

Almost all componens will have access to their own dev server. It is more lightweight and only focuses on stuff related
to the component (it does not compile `ifdesignsystem.min.css`).
