For best accessibility practices, follow these simple rules:

-   A link (navigation) should look like a link and be coded like a link.
-   A button (action) should look like a button and be coded like a button.

However, there are of course, exceptions to the rule:

-   If you are using a `<a>`-tag for an action (as in submit form, even if it takes you to a new URL), change it to
    a `<button>`
-   If you are using a `<button>` to change URL (location), change it to a `<a>`.
    -   However, if it is the action that is changing the URL, keep the `<button>`
    -   If the URL is not reachable by direct linking/deep linking, keep the `<button>`
