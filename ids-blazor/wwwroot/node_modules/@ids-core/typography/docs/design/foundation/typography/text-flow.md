Below is two text flow examples. The first one is not adjusted to the baseline, but the second is.

<figure class="sg figure types">
  <ol class="sg types list fixed">
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text flow vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text flow normalized vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <figcaption class="sg figure caption">
    <ol class="sg figure caption list">
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">Untouched</li>
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">With basekick text flow</li>
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">Normalized, with line-heights going up in 5 ( 40px, 30px and 25px)</li>
    </ol>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

Now, when we add lines to indicate line-heights (baseline), look how the text aligns with them:

<figure class="sg figure types">
  <ol class="sg types list fixed">
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text baseline-helper text vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text flow baseline-helper text vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
    <li class="sg types list item">
      <div class="sg types type" style="padding: 10%">
        <div class="if example airy">
          <div class="if text flow normalized text baseline-helper text vertical-spacing-base" style="height: 100%;">
            <h2 class="if heading medium">Heading - Medium 1</h2>
            <p class="if text lead">Leading text with a bunch of other words. Just testing this out</p>
            <p class="if text body">This is the body text, we need to add some placeholder text here. Perhaps not the basic Lorum ipsum dolor sit amet text, but something else? We could do that, but not certain of which, there are so many! But what if we just type the first things that enters our mind, so that the user can just get a hint of what's going on here?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <figcaption class="sg figure caption">
    <ol class="sg figure caption list">
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">Untouched</li>
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">With basekick text flow</li>
      <li class="sg figure caption list item">Normalized, same line heights</li>
    </ol>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="if alert-banner warning">
  The small miss-alignment to the text on right hand side examples are due to the line heights we use are not based on a linear scale. This might improve in the future.
