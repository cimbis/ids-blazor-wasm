Modern versions of assistive technologies will announce CSS generated content, as well as specific Unicode characters.
To avoid unintended and confusing output in screen readers (particularly when icons are used purely for decoration), we
hide them with the `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.

If you're creating controls with no other text (such as a `<button>` that only contains an icon), you should always
provide alternative content to identify the purpose of the control, so that it will make sense to users of assistive
technologies. In this case, you could add an `aria-label` attribute on the control itself.
