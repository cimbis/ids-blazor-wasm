<span class="if heading smallest">Context based</span>

The sizing of icons is context based. We use 16px and upwards based on the context. As long as the size of the icon adheres to the baseline grid (4px/8px), any size is useable, depending on contect.

<span class="if heading smallest">Stroke, line width</span>

In some occasions the icons need to amend the stroke width manually, based on the placement and context of the icon.
