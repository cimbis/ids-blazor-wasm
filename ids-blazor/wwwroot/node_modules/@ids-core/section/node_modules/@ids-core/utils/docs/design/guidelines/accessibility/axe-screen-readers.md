<div class="if text layout columns">
<div class="if text body">

There are occasional instances where content should be made available to screen reader users, but hidden from sighted users. In most cases, if content (particularly content that provides functionality or interactivity) is important enough to provide to screen reader users, it should probably be made available to all users. Cases where verbose cues or instructions are provided only for screen reader users are most likely a reflection of poor design and accessibility. However, there are a few cases where information is apparent visually, but may not be apparent to screen reader users. In these cases, it may be appropriate to mark-up content in a way that it is read by a screen reader, but invisible to sighted users.

You can use the class `.if.sr-only` to accomplish this.

```html
<div class="if …">
  <img class="if …" … />
  <span class="if axe sr-only">Descriptive text to the image</span>
</div>
```
