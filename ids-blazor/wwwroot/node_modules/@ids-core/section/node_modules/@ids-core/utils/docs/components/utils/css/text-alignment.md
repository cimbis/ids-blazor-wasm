We provide easy to use classes to align text content.

### Usage {#text-alignment-usage}

For left, right, and center alignment on all breakpoints use non responsive classes.

<div class="if">
  <p class="if u-text-left">Left aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
  <p class="if u-text-center">Center aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
  <p class="if u-text-right">Right aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
</div>

```html
<p class="if u-text-left">Left aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
<p class="if u-text-center">Center aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
<p class="if u-text-right">Right aligned text on all breakpoints.</p>
```

For left, right, and center alignment, responsive classes are available, so the content can be aligned diferently on specific breakpoints.

<p class="if u-text-left--xs">Left aligned text on breakpoints sized XS or wider.</p>
<p class="if u-text-center--smlr">Center aligned center on breakpoints sized SMLR or wider.</p>
<p class="if u-text-right--sm">Right aligned center on breakpoints sized SM or wider.</p>

```html
<p class="if u-text-left--xs">Left aligned text on breakpoints sized XS or wider.</p>
<p class="if u-text-center--smlr">Center aligned center on breakpoints sized SMLR or wider.</p>
<p class="if u-text-right--sm">Right aligned center on breakpoints sized SM or wider.</p>
```

### Implementation {#text-alignment-implementation}

```html
<span class="if u-text-left">
  This content is left aligned for all breakpoints.
</span>

<span class="if u-text-center">

</span>

<span class="if u-text-right">

</span>
```

```html
<span class="if u-text-left--[xxs|xs|smlr|sm|md|lg|xl|xxl|huge|huger]">

</span>

<span class="if u-text-center--[xxs|xs|smlr|sm|md|lg|xl|xxl|huge|huger]">
  This content is center aligned from a given breakpoint and up.
</span>

<span class="if u-text-right--[xxs|xs|smlr|sm|md|lg|xl|xxl|huge|huger]">
