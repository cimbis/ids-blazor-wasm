Icons help the user find a desired action or piece of information relevant to their task. Icons can be used to mark a type of notification, status or validation, an action link or button, a type of insurance or sometimes (but rarely) an action button.

The icon should speak for itself and the user should understand what the icon means without reading the supporting text. Icons help the user scan to the correct action without reading text.

<strong class="if">Do not use icons</strong> just for the sake of using an icon, or for decoration. We don't want to clutter the user interface with anything that is not absolutely necessary or beneficial to the user.
